# hasura-dotnet-graphql

A repository for use with the [hasura-quick-start](https://github.com/Adron/hasura-quick-start) repository to show how to integrate Hasura for use with a [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) based [Hot Chocolate GraphQL API](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-platform).

This repo, I've yet to build out the containerized app but it still serves to show how and what a C# written .NET stack GraphQL API would look like. I've thus used this repo in demos to show how this, along with the related [hasura-quick-start](https://github.com/Adron/hasura-quick-start) could be used to connect data across different APIs using Hasura.

Also, it'd be great if you've got the ~20 minutes to submit a PR with this image containerized that would be great! Please do. For now I'll get to it when I can for ease of deployment, but until then, this is the delivered .NET app.  ðŸŽ‰
